## L001 — Write docs before implementation (spec-first)

**What happened**: Implemented icon-based UI and drag/connect support, then wrote the `docs/` spec afterward. The user pointed out that the correct order is to write the spec in `docs/` first, then implement based on it.

**Rule**:

- Always write the specification in `docs/` before writing any code (Specification-Driven Development)
- Implementation is the codification of the spec; if reality diverges, update the spec immediately
- Code and docs are one unit — and docs come first
